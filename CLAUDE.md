# Voice Food Logger Monorepo Migration

## Project Overview
Migrating the existing Flask voice food logger backend into a monorepo architecture with the new iOS app, creating a complete cross-platform food logging system.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Backend (Flask)
- **Location**: `~/Documents/GitHub/voice-food-logger/`
- **Architecture**: Complete voice → transcription → processing → storage pipeline
- **Key Features**:
  - Groq Whisper API for transcription
  - Groq Qwen LLM for intelligent food parsing
  - 13-food nutrition database with fuzzy matching
  - Smart unit conversion (grams, cups, scoops, etc.)
  - Daily aggregation and macro calculations
  - JSON-based storage with backward compatibility
  - Web interface with iPhone-style recording

### Existing iOS App  
- **Location**: Current directory
- **Status**: ✅ Working with voice recording functionality
- **Features**: SwiftUI interface, AVFoundation recording, microphone permissions

## Migration Goals

### 1. Monorepo Structure
```
VoiceFoodLogger/
├── ios/                          # iOS app
│   ├── VoiceFoodLogger.xcodeproj
│   ├── VoiceFoodLogger/
│   └── VoiceFoodLoggerTests/
├── backend/                      # Flask API server
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── transcription.py
│   ├── processing.py
│   ├── storage.py
│   ├── data/nutrition_db.json
│   ├── processing/prompts/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── shared/                       # Shared resources
│   ├── docs/
│   ├── schemas/
│   └── testing/
└── README.md
```

### 2. Integration Architecture
- iOS app sends audio files to Flask backend
- Backend processes using existing intelligence
- Returns structured nutrition data to iOS
- iOS handles local storage and UI display
- Preserve all backend processing logic

### 3. API Design
```
POST /api/process-audio          # Main processing pipeline
GET  /api/entries/:date          # Daily entries
GET  /api/daily-totals/:date     # Aggregated totals  
GET  /api/nutrition-database     # Available foods
POST /api/manual-entry           # Text-based food entry
```

  - [ ] iOS integration guide
  - [ ] Deployment instructions
  - [ ] User manual and features

## Technical Decisions

### Data Flow
1. **iOS**: Record audio → Upload to backend
2. **Backend**: Transcribe → Parse → Lookup nutrition → Store → Return data
3. **iOS**: Display results → Cache locally → Show in UI

### Storage Strategy
- **Backend**: JSON files for simplicity and existing compatibility
- **iOS**: Core Data for local caching and offline access
- **Sync**: iOS queries backend for latest data on app launch

### Error Handling
- **Network failures**: Local retry with exponential backoff
- **Processing errors**: Clear error messages to user
- **Data conflicts**: Backend is source of truth
- **Offline mode**: Display cached data with sync indicators

## Success Metrics
- [ ] iOS app successfully uploads and processes audio
- [ ] All existing backend functionality preserved
- [ ] New nutrition data displays correctly in iOS
- [ ] Daily totals and history work across platforms
- [ ] Complete test coverage for both components
- [ ] Documentation covers full integration workflow

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1: Create monorepo structure and migrate backend
2. Test backend functionality in new location
3. Begin iOS networking integration
4. Implement comprehensive testing strategy
5. Deploy and validate complete system
